        Where man is not.
    Griboyedoff
    Indifferent and sedate,
"'Tis habit, Lenski."--"Is your ill
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
"'Twas possible then, happiness--
"Abandon hope for ever here!"
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!"
"Aline!"
"And is it long since back he came?
"And is it she? It must be--no--
"At Larina's."--"Hem, that is queer!
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill--"
"Bring dinner now without delay!"Upon the table in a trice
"But death from him will be delight.
"But strange am I to happiness;
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
"But which, my dear?--In days of yore
"But, _matushka_, to Moscow you
"But," cried Zaretski in amaze,
"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
"Command me, darling, what you choose"--
"Delighted."--"When?"--"This very night.
"Do not--you might--suspicious be;
"Drive on!" the cheerful cry goes forth,
"Enough to see one winter's end;
"Enough, arise! for much we need
"Good-bye, Oneguine, I must go."--
"Had he been long here, and where from?
"He hath neglected us of late."--
"He promised here this day to ride,"
"He's here! Eugene is here!
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
"How came you then to wed a man?"--
"How now, Oneguine, yawning still?"--
"How often in thine arms I lay;
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now."
"I call to witness God on high--"
"I celebrate a comrade young
"I shall expire," Tattiana cried,
"I weep. And if within your breast
"I with my friend intend to fight!"If he had only known the wound
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"--
"Ideal," he had drowsy grown.
"If the domestic hearth could bless--
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
"Is he known to you?"--"Yes and No."Wherefore regarding him express
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!"
"Monsieur l'Abbe" a starving Gaul,
"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.
"My darling child, thou art in pain.--
"My darling, growing old am I!
"My heart's delight, thou art not well."--
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
"No matter, look immediately.
"No misery I see in that"--
"Not at all."--"That I can't conceive!
"Not in the least, assured am I!"--
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
"Oh! I remember, where is he?"--
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!"But nothing changed in them is seen,
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
"Olinka is her junior, see.
"Oneguine, I was younger then,
"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,
"Poor Yorick," mournfully he said,
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?"
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
"Shall we commence?"--"Let it be so,"
"She who with melancholy face
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
"Tania, my eldest child, you know"--
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!"--
"The family are all quite well--
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?"--
"The post hath kept him, it is like."
"The younger, you're in love with her!"
"Then amongst strangers I was left--
"Then come with me." The prince proceeds,
"Then send your grandson quietly
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
"To--?"--"Larina."--"Tattiana?"--"So.
"Warm yourself here a little space!"
"We never loved in days of old,
"Well!"--"I the elder should prefer,
"What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.
"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.At home arriving he addressed
"What can be done? She is no child!"
"What can be drearier than the house,
"What is your name?" The boor looked dazed,
"What! Grandison?"--"Yes, certainly!"
"Who will be there?"--"The family.
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?"--Let us congratulations pay
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
"You have a letter to me sent.
"Your fashionable world I hate,
"Your second you have left behind!"
"_The date, his fleeting years how long--
"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
'Fare thee well, and if for ever,
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
'Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_"
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!"
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
'Tis dreadful--ye agree, I hope--
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
'Tis fearful to anticipate
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
'Tis silent--on her shines the moon--
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
'Tis there that arrant fops display
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
'Tis time she to the altar went!
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
'Twas these he read and these alone
'Twould serve ye in an epigram--
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
(So 'twas with us in former years,
(This by command; for it was found,
(Though certainly mankind he knew
."My second!" cried in turn Eugene,
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A Russian household simple quite,
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
A Russian poem's mechanism
A Vampire fond of meditation,
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
A ball here, there a children's treat,
A ball in Peter's capital,
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
A box of terrible import.
A breathless silence then, prolonged--
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain--
A certain little escapade
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A constant harping on one tune,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A country damsel's album trim,
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A door he opens. But why shrank
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A due which must to earth be paid.The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
A duellist of classic mind,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A faithful model she appeared
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A first success light pinions gave,
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fond and careful mother been.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friar black approaching near,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
A gust of passion never tore
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A happy destiny ordained:
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A hermit's life Oneguine led,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
A horse's hoofs she hears--She shrinks!
A hundred times will not repeat,
A jolly song and distant horn;
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
A joyous troop of little boys
A kerchief round her silver hair
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest;
A life of fact, not fiction, led--
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little farther please to read
A little virgin mirror peeps.
A load of care upon the maid."But lo! forth from the valleys dun
A loaded pistol in his hand."Advance!"--
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A love which knew no limitation,
A lover's letter might convey,
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A maiden's secrets--of the heart.Triumphs--their own or those of friends--
A mansion--by the window, see!
A marriageable maid matured,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new proprietor arrived,
A new world was made manifest!Although we know that Eugene had
A noted fop who gambled hard.Like his, her dress was always nice,
A notoriety proclaimed,
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A pair of bullets--nought beside--
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A paragon of virtue he!
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A passionate desire to bend
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A philosophic anchorite:
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
A print without the picture's grace,
A promenade in twilight late
A prudent man like you and brave
A register of fleeting thought,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
A rivulet beneath them shoots
A scant attendance Lenski showed
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A sense of social delight,
A shape half cat and half a crane.Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
A simple tombstone hath been set.There, when the rains of spring we mark
A single being: 'twas in fine
A slave of actresses capricious,
A smile from slumbering nature clear
A something somehow have obtained,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A sportsman who in covert lies.But finally she heaves a sigh,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.To consanguineous dinners they
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possess--
A substitute for lamps we hail!Obedient she had ever been
A table to the fire is brought,
A tangled wilderness around.
A tender couplet he combined,
A thick immense neglected grove
A timid love to banishment?--
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
A true account and in detail.But not at present, though sincerely
A valuable hostage gained,
A very troublesome disease,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A village and beneath, a wood,
A vision desolate and drear
A visionary mortified,
A visionary personage
A weary season was at hand--
A while ago the winter spent,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A windmill too a jig performs
A wish from place to place to roam,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
A young Armida's lips to press,
A young and handsome galliard.
A young man motionless he saw,
Abandon cities riotous,
Abandoned he his country seat,
Abandoning insane delight,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
About the rain and flax and cattle."--
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,--
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Address to you one single phrase
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Adroitly seized and carried her;
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Affection how did you requite?
After the wedded couple strain;
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhood--love?The hours once more Oneguine counts,
Against my inclination, friends,
Age immature averse to cheat--
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Ah! he has gone the other way"--
Ah! it may be, affection true
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Akulka who was once Celine,
Alarm the winter journey gave.The date was fixed though oft postponed,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! how wretched now my lot!"
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Alas! with merited reproach.
Albums magnificent which scare
Alike by sighs and flattery.
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All about Olga--to a light
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.Terror assails her. Hastily
All breathless and without replies.
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
All in the good old style appears,
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.Eight rubbers were already played,
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire;
All that the heart would fain express--
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All this was novel to Eugene.
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are gone--
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Allure the young gallant
Almost became a poet say--
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Alone within his habitation
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Along the hall, and high above
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already dance to song proceeds;
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also my wretched liberty
Also one Viazemski, remarking
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also their feet--yet ne'ertheless
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
Am I to go through the whole list?""How dull you are this morning, nurse!"
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
Amidst successes flattering
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.--
An ardent heart and yet so mild?--
An ear to my confession lend;
An ever transcendental flight;
An exile from their troublous reign,
An explanation: she was scared,
An honourable course ye took,
An hour passed by--another--till,
An idle anchorite and sad,
An infant maiden doth exhort
An inn at every stage erect.But now, what wretched roads one sees,
An innate love of meditation,
An invalid from lung complaint.
An oval countenance and pink,
And  they
And "Agathon" replied, amazed.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Eugene soon discovered there
And Flianoff, pensioned councillor,
And Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And I admired their common sense
And I confess that now-a-days
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
And I to give thee cakes was wont?"--
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And Lenski followed--a light broke--
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And Tania's husband soon appeared.--
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a guitar produced we see,
And a half rubles down gave she;
And a long time about her talked.
And a malicious epigram
And a new diadem supplied.
And a romance in ancient style
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
And after Albion's proud lyre
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again;
And aimless journeys did commence--
And all in snow is buried deep.The wood she enters--bear behind,--
And all that from thy hand proceeds--
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all the three to breakfast went;
And all thy precious elegies,
And all with one accord agreed,
And all without her husband's leave.
And all your love on self bestow;
And alphabetically tries
And also fashionable beaux.Our hero stops and doth alight,
And also that my feeble verse--
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And an encouragement did breathe
And an habitual sense of pain;
And an old gent the poet marking
And ancient usages observed
And as a country damsel roved,
And at economy was great;
And at the altar of their fame
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And at the table sat her down.To tragedy, the fainting fit,
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happy--as I might.
And be not in advance severe.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And better, if I judge aright;
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And bitter torment never known.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
And blest the shadows of the night."To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
And blush to own himself reflect.
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a sweet delusion he
And by that shady rivulet
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
And by the world repeated oft,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And can it be? But late a child
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed;
And chattering loud sit down to dine.Ceased for a space all chattering.
And clad in airy costume took
And comfort of each country dame,
And consolation soon begot.
And contemplative dreaminess;
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And crossed with trembling hand the maid."I am in love," her whispers tell
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dames of fine organisations,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And devastate the woods around.There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
And disappear in space; then she
And distance interposed in vain,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?"--"We live near."
And dream of life's delightful dawn?The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,--
And ease the tortures of the heart--
And education runs to waste,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And enmity and hope and love--
And every morning I awake
And every year distributed
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced."Princesse, mon ange!"--"Pachette!"--
And eye which gleams with inspiration--
And far removed from rumour vain;
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And fashion's gay frivolities;
And fashionable magazines,
And female tears hysterical,
And fields my joys have ever been;
And finally he deigns let fall
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.By the sick lady's gaiety
And fled afar--she followed me.
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And following them ye might espy
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And for a time our course delay,
And form a network left and right;
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the Millionaya afar
And from the country all around
And from the misty woodland nigh
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gallops to her house away.
And gave himself but little pain
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And gently hovered o'er my head?
And glasses unemployed all night;
And glittering simpletons beside;Amid sly, pusillanimous
And gloomy epigrams malicious.How oft, when on a summer night
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grant success to labour long;
And grasp a stirrup fortunate--
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And happy unto you appear.
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And harmony was soon restored.
And hastened to his uncle's side,
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar"
And hated casual visitors,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed!_--
And heedless of approval seems,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And her upon the threshold laid.Recovering, Tania gazes round;
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And his strange conduct at the dance
And homeward like an arrow tore.My friends, the poet ye regret!
And honestly 'tis my belief
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And hot with jealous indignation,
And hurried home his awful freight.
And husbands' tedious amity?
And if Tattiana mine had found--
And impiously should declare,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her hand a French romance.
And in her languid bosom raise
And in her native language she
And in society might shed
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And irrigate them with champagne;
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And isolated from all men,
And jests doth recapitulate.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And judgment which unsteady veers
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And leads a solitary life?
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
And leans upon the monster's arm,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And led me off to church with song."
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like Napoleons each of us
And like a palisade flit by.
And like a shadow haunted her.
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like the prisoner's our delight
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! he is already there!
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And lonely through the forest creeps.""Is she in love?" quoth one. "With whom?
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanished.
And love's delicious diadem
And loves you as--a relative!Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
And make a dark existence shine
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered;
And marking Tania's agitation,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And meditative from the spot
And meditative homeward goes,
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
And my Eugene the path must trace--
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And my romance's open theme
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And necessary fools allowed.
And never hath our language proud
And never was the ear affright
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees;
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she springs
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now we hear delightedly
And now, I mournfully confess,
And o'er the granite coping bent,
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft at eventide a throng
And oft in whispers would impart
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And our swift troikas never tire;
And overcome antipathies
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And pelt him with cherries,
And physic bring with mournful face,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.I like this word exceedingly
And sallied forth one brilliant morn--
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermon--but in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived;
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.He read as vainly as before,
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And silently I here must die--
And since I pulled thee by the ear--
And slowly life coagulates--
And so Tattiana was her name,
And so departed. But Eugene,
And so--God bless them, if He list.In this the love of the fair sex
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
And soon Oneguine's door beside
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.They in a peaceful life preserved
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fire--
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And still the coachmen round the fires
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate;
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the Skatenines, aged pair,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice;
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lime alley's twilight dim
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide;
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And then "monsieur" supplied her place;
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then to meditate for days
And then with blind credulity
And these the attentive maid observed
And they the waters recommend.He went not--sooner was prepared
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
And though I read it with distress,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead."Thus did our friend Oneguine preach:
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to Oneguine far away
And to revive Tattiana seemed.The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And to the field of honour led;
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.This northern summer of our own,
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery;
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread--
And unto whom we all allude
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.Full many a lovely star hath night
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.All bustle when he makes a sign:
And views amongst themselves advance
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
And we--an unattractive set--
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.And in reality one day
And what will Destiny concede?"Farther Tattiana's walks extend--
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewed--
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where a madrigal occurs
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wholly occupied his day--
And wild among them grew her words--
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.Romances pleased her from the first,
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And you, O maids immaculate,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.The gulf between them was so vast,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And, inspiration firing me,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Anew the flames of passion start
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Another bard with art divine
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given;
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Another tribune of the ball
Another visit hastes to pay.
Another with cock's head appeared,
Another! to none other I
Anticipating woe she pined,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appear; along the road of Tver
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Applause, the people's donative.
Approach not to gaze at
Approach not to hearken
Approach, approach; I am thine own."Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are oft deceptive--like their feet.Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,
Are turned upon her. All combine
Are ye replaced by other maids
Around her neck, now violently
Around my stanzas incomplete
Around the carriage of the pair--
Around the garden homeward hies.
Around the meadow and the grove.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arrange without the least delay--
As Saadi anciently averred--
As Winter in their purity,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
As cyphers others to appraise,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
As every journal now entreats,
As formerly much agitation.
As formerly the shepherd sits
As giddy youth's hilarity--
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
As if he cruelly had joked!'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
As if impossible it were
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
As in a garden when I grew,
As in a thicket's humble shade,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
As in the timid forest deer,
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As it were, tore himself away.
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many dinners I rehearse,
As many entertainments be!
As men who much had done that day.
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As on the rapid wings of thought
As once, to fill the rapid page
As one who bivouacs afield,
As partner of my mournful days,
As rosy lips without a smile,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
As the reflection of his age,
As the sins of my youthful days
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As to a worthy man and good!But sad is the reflection made,
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As we lure the young gallant,
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
As with innumerable fires.
As yet none had discovered aught;
As your light footprints on the green.Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Assemblies oligarchical
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assistance ever will extend,
Assuredly should not have been
Asunder was and hate prepared?
At Larina's abode produced
At Russ she was by no means clever
At a great feast against desire,
At an old aunt's they had arrived
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At early morn returns the maid
At eighteen not to play the fool!
At eventide would hither come,
At fifty who relief obtained
At first for books was disinclined,
At first such contradictions wrought
At first, I clung to secrecy:
At first, but soon became inured
At forty suffered from the gout,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At last became a ruined man.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!" cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
At morn I must assuredly
At morn an icy bath within
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
At neighbouring hospitalities.
At prisoner's base she never played.
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At table she was sitting by
At the front gates, but in brief space
At the same hour she oped her eyes
At thirty who was married well,
At this time almost understood.
At times my reason almost bends,
At times talk nonsense with design;
At times three words to him addressed
At times to silence would resort,
At times, if only once a week,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Athwart the snow four paces came--
Attend in male attire arrayed.On this artistical retreat
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Attentive listened to his speech,
Attentive listened to the lad.But more the passions occupy
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Attractive in its banefulness?
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light--
Authors replete with sacred fire
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Avenge himself in proper style.
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Awakens secret merriment
Away her golden earrings tore;
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Awhile sound conversation seems
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Aye bids ye in some way or other--
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Bard of the "Feasts," and mournful breast,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Basins and jugs--well! everything
Bear gone--she at the threshold placed;
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Because a member I became.Once more to idleness consigned,
Because he could not gourmandise
Because he yawned at the bare view
Because her passion wanted art,
Because in singleness of thought
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because she was so innocent,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before he eighteen years attained.Since Eugene in that solitude
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Before you agonized to die--
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Behold! the world's opinion!
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--"
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Believe me, of my present shame
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the stormy sea one day
Beside the thundering abyss
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Besides, a duellist well-known
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.Thou also, reader generous,
Beyond this may attempt to write_.Infallibly you there will find
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both day and night he now must pass
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Bouyanoff courted. She refused.
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore
Bouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Bruin is marching at her back!She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Buried in meditation deep,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But Eugene long hath left the press
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But I abandoned their array,
But I am now another's bride--
But I await thee: scarce alive
But I came not to adulate:
But I must add to what I write
But I must now employ my Muse
But I perceive thou dost not heed--"
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But I, in love, was mute and dull.The Muse appeared, when love passed by
But I--what is all this to me?
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But Lenski, having no desire
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But Olga would not such peruse.
But Summer swiftly fades away
But Tania just as in a dream
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--
But as to fighting--'twill appear!
But at a later, sterile age,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But better loved the soft repose
But boldly I myself resign:
But borne in spirit far away
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But competition I abjure
But contrary to her advice
But could not. Then she questioned him:--
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
But fashionable hatred's flame
But finally grew bored by her.
But finally he oped his eyes
But finally in wedlock bind.
But finally she softly said:
But first permission did request
But followed the strict rules of art,
But fools--their calumnies and sneers"--
But from the Muses' loftiest height
But gazes on Oneguine's face
But grant with magnanimity
But gray Phillippevna the door
But grown familiar side by side
But he desired not to beguile
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But home his body to despatch
But if my lot unfortunate
But if the truth I must relate,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But lights incendiary flames
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
But lo! already the moon's light
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lo! the friends to chat commence."How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look you--ah! do not refuse."
But man of sense and probity.He might his motives have narrated,
But memory like a serpent's tooth
But merely to exasperate;
But my Oneguine the whole eve
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But no reply unto her made.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.The break of day she doth not see,
But now a question in this wise
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now in her effulgence pale
But now my mind is desolate,
But now our hero we must leave
But now ridiculous a bit.Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But now--my very blood congeals,
But now--none heeds the monument
But now--what brings you to my feet?--
But nowhere can she find repose,
But of this love, e'en casually,
But on the third of grove and mead
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But presently she tried to read;
But promise of our meeting gave,
But proudly in his song preserved
But round the hostess scintillate
But say he was a genius who
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But send your grandson before long."No answer all that day was borne.
But shall depict the touching scene
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon she altered all her ways,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But stares into the darkness deep.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But such is not for me. I brood
But such is not my project now,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But suddenly all changed around!
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But sweeter still it is to arrange
But tell me what am I to do?
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But the date subsequently changed
But the indifferent princess,
But the young unpolluted heart
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But this a heinous crime appeared
But this adventure's consequence
But this amusement delicate
But this is my advice, 'twere best
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But thoughts meander far away--
But time flies and she doth forget
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But to the garden once again
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?--
But turn we once more to our dame.
But turning morning into night,
But ultimately doth approach.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what astonished do I find
But what results? His eyes peruse
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
But when the winter season came
But when two minutes she had sat,
But where Melpomene doth rave
But wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,
But who abandon it--as I
But who in that choice company
But why are your cheeks whitening?"
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittle--
But with austerity!--for you
But with confused and bashful air,
But with her elder sister I
But word for word his letter read.All is foreseen. My secret drear
But would not look at Cicero.
But wretched who anticipates,
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
But you must both be quite tired out!
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But, after mutual compliments,
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But, as he never opened them,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
But, her own room in memory,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
But, that life longer may remain,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
But, when Oneguine's turn came round,
By "belle Tattiana" to replace.Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.Habit alleviates the grief
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By Olga's hand distributed
By Providence's dark decree!
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
By a rich pie were occupied--
By absence who hath chilled his love,
By an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:
By an avowal just as plain.
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
By bee and butterfly which pass.'Twas she who first within his breast
By children and by faithful wife
By computation) it is like
By daily life deteriorated,
By dull insensibility,
By every proper-minded wife,
By flattery and lover's art--
By fond illusions once possest
By friendship how they were abused,
By his embarrassed dignity--
By indolence and languor fired
By liberties or loose or light.And yet the city's flower was there,
By love's inevitable flame.
By many a lamp illuminate,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
By neighbouring families bewept,
By night prepared for sorcery,
By other thoughts be occupied.But I the products of my Muse,
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By rank as settled by the State.
By recklessness amuse or shame
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By the fine silver of the north.
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
By their own horses, not the post--
By time
By visions who was ne'er deranged
By waters shining tranquilly,
By what idea or observation
By whom the youthful bard was slain?"--
Byron's capricious phantasy
Calling to mind your icy look
Callous to all he seemed to be.Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Callous to all on earth become--
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter his--
Came forth in all her magic sheen.The snow descends and buries all,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Can count the time without much fuss--
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Can she have been a moment gone
Can we not stealthily make out
Cannot they amicably smile
Canto the First of this romance.
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;
Careless of every social rule,
Careless of fame his spirit high
Caricatures he now designed
Carried a truth divine away;
Carried away by ecstasy,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Caught him and by the collar took
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Certain misfortune near opined.
Chained to his bedside night and day
Change of position had essayed,
Charming is your sincerity,
Charming with grave simplicity.He sang of love--to love a slave.
Charms more enduring in the end.
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Choosing a profitable trade,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,--
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Come sing we in chorus
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Command him not to say a word--
Commence a new career in life
Companion of my childhood's days.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Confront thy fated torturer!Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Conquer by passion and address,
Conscious of death approximate,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Constant affection intertwined
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Conventionality's dull tool--
Corneille's majestic genius,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Could in romantic mantle drape
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light."And is it," meditates Eugene.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?"
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Cunning already to display
Cursing his own stupidity,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Customs by ages sanctified,
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Daily of love in solitude.
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Dark shadows thicken--a dread cry
Dark was the valley and the wood
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Debate commanded ample food--
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
Deep in the distant province rude,
Deep in the greenwood far away?Arising with the morning's light,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!Alas! my stomach it betrays
Delighted glances in return;
Delighted much his former ways
Delighted, almost sane in mind.But once more pensive and distressed
Delusions of a mind untried,
Demands that I translate for you
Depart in peace and friendly live?
Departed, ordered out his horse
Depicted on your haughty face!
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Descended swift in turbid streams
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Describe in detail the affair,
Descried before me suddenly!
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Desire to rule ye may observe
Desirous to annihilate
Despair and anger seize on me,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Detecting him the passing horse
Detest him for a brother slain?
Develops and matures its powers,
Device of rural minds acute!)Young maidens, fair maidens,
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Diminishes as years decline.
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Discovered much absurdity,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Displayed a noble rectitude--
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Distracted by her grief appears
Divinity without access
Do agitate his late repose.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Do me a favour and appear.
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Domestic life attracts me still,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Doth in us or our names appear,
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go--
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Dressed like a London dandy he
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
E'en as the poet says he leant.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
E'en for an instant find delight,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Economy political,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Either she saw not or ignored;
Either with him or thee in song,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,--
Employ your glasses constantly,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Encountered punishment complete,
Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Enhances love in estimation
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows--
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
Ennui can in the country dwell
Enough! my pack is now unslung--
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay--
Enraptured was he if allowed
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Epicurean philosophers,
Epistle second, note the third,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Espy him approaching,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
Eternally to imitate
Eugene at first began to dream,
Eugene designed with me to start
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet--
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Eugene of course related nought,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Even amusing fools we miss
Even as Moscow, city proud.Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Even as the love of children dear.
Even beneath her parents' roof
Even the rosy wafer dries
Eventually petrify
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Ever to hear the same replies
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Examine her from head to foot.
Examined, mended, newly found
Except one by the window placed
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
Excruciate the heart and late
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Exist--that their immortal band
Existence calmly sped along,
Existence without wife or friends,
Existence would not make a curse,
Extended--haunt which Dryads love.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Extinguished ashes do not blaze--
Faces which we meet everywhere
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Familiar to him long ago.
Fantastic images shall swarm
Far from his Italy--his own.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Fashion is there immutable,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Feeling in others much esteemed.With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Felled a calumniator base!
Finally tost his arms in air
First reconciled and then content;
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Follow up love--a secret meeting
Fond declarations they invite
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For a protracted space of time.
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For consecrate to me he fell
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For ever faithful will abide."
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For ever your Tattiana leave.
For evermore had disappeared.
For evermore is separate.
For every loyal Russian breast!
For first "madame" his wants observed,
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
For him an honourable grave,
For him were but of little worth,
For journalistic deglutition
For law I _far niente_ take
For long he had endured them all.
For long--for ever. To be sure
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
For my wild garden and bookcase,--
For o'er a word to fashion known,
For on their brows I trembling read
For otherwise--God only knows!
For our Automedons are fire
For our amusement ever made
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For promises her feet reveal
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For rural solitude and dreams,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
For summer to the country flown,
For tallow, wood and other things
For the first time the hammer clicks.
For the impatient chief instead.
For the young poet they display.
For there he left a mournful trace.
For treachery had done its worst;
For twice you came to them and yet
For us, may be for many a year.
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
For which the poet agonized
For who imposture can endure,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?I have known beauties cold and raw
For your instruction here to tell
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Forgotten in the village lone,
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Found the ideal of my youth,
Found them in darkness side by side,
Four deadly paces do they span;
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Friends and companions,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From Romulus unto our day.
From apprehension of the cost,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.To the assembly her they bear.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From everything the heart held dear
From first to last page to the rim.
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From habit or maliciously,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
From happy inspiration flow,
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From henceforth I confide to thee!
From her half-open vest of night.
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From public and from private ties,
From shades of the relentless past.
From storms protection having sought,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the dread pistol turn away.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From whose analysis minute
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Full of exasperating thought.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Furious he from the table rose;
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing--see!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand--
Gazing upon a note below.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Give me just half a glass of wine--
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Gliding in negligent career,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
God grant I meet not at a ball
God grant that all who herein glance,
God knows! The very trace is lost.'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
God save his soul eternally
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
Grant that I err not on the road."
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Habit was given us in distress
Habit would bring indifference.
Had a deluded victim been
Had bid her sigh for without hope--
Had come both friends and enemies--
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had finished life amid his sons,
Had killed me had the like been told."
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had much to do at home that day,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had rendered him an invalid;
Had run across her path at speed,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hard by the window took her place."--
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have entered never to return.
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my Oneguine--suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Having for money's sake alone
Having lost all in life we prize.
Having once fixed your interest,
Having performed his service truly,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
Having this mournful document
He "Benedetta" used to hum,
He _cannot_ give me happiness."
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
He back as from a sudden blow?--
He bending whispered in her ear
He bends his course to Talon's, where
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He brought from mystic Germany
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
He called upon me Christmas Eve--
He cared no longer there to stay,
He conversation would have led--
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He drops his pistol silently.He on his bosom gently placed
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares--
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He hath acquired the world's esteem
He heard his soul's complaint within,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,"
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He knits his brows--'tis silent all.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.He rings in haste; in haste arrives
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw;
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on the conflagration frowned.
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
He racked his brains to find its clue
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
He sang of separation grim,
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.He was beloved: or say at least,
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is master--that is plain;
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He to the festival repairs,
He took no more the slightest heed;
He took the room wherein the old
He used to hate--and was no fool--
He usually was glad to see
He wakes--they with a letter come--
He wanders in his indolence;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful fool--
He was an honest gentleman,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error; for Eugene
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He who life's frosts which early wrung
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
He would not that a man ye slay
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
He's a freemason, so we think.
He's a straightforward little chap."
Heard he the truth? And thus she could--
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Hears not my importunity!
Heart would not throb albeit in jest--
Heaved an involuntary sigh
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
Heedless of your despairing cry?Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her agitation and distress
Her all in all did constitute;
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Oh! who her speechless agonies
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Her head upon her breast declines
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her money counted, and designed
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Her path across the plain doth keep--
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulder--Olga swiftly came--
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears--
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Him a disquietude did seize,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Himself transformed into a hack;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His ardent soul with full delight.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad,
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His care unto his pistols' plight,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His chambers close wherein confined
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His constant soul could ever tire,
His course unto the running brook.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His daily occupations, lo!
His daughter's book to ascertain
His ditties were as pure and bright
His double sashes and his grate,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His energy and impotence.And numerous pages had preserved
His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His fate shall presently decide.
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook
His footing on the treacherous rime
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His hate by slander, and who spends
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His heart reciprocated still
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His immorality of mind
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His kneeling posture he retains--
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His momentary loving glance
His mother from the door doth scold.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His name: the tenderness of home
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
His own antagonists expert,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His recent glory he invokes.
His relative and friend as well.
His ruffian bravery adored,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His son and mortgages his lands.
His son is married, just conceive!""And he--but of him presently--
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His soul by crash of music fired,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
His spirit was intent upon.
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His valet brings him letters three.
His vanity first let us pique
His visit she had not awaited,
His wadded coat and cap with peak;
His watch, the sun in turn he views--
His weary head declined at rest,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His wife was also mad upon
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Hope with her fascinating power
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Horror! had she not better stay
How I have erred and felt the rod!
How artless was the note which spoke
How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preach--
How much is in that word expressed!
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deception's art,
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse, I'm well.
How with thy medal I would play,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,"--
However cherries might abound,
However, Tania's letter reading,
However, the mazurka lacks
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Hung like a print against the wall,
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
I Apuleius gladly read
I also wandered there of old,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
I am in love, my hour hath come!
I am not strong enough to state;
I am not worthy them in aught;
I am--in love--you know--don't tell!"
I ask, all ye who poets are,
I blame not your behaviour--
I by the button-hole seize fast
I can't conceive a little dear
I can't translate the adjective.
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
I cannot tell on what pretence--
I cannot tell the reason why,
I cannot understand. But lo!
I did not please you. Why pursue
I envied sore the billows tall,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
I feel, allotted is my span;
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
I formerly admired her much
I guard it as a holy thing,
I had found my predestinate,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
I heard thy voice's resonance
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parny's tender pen
I know there's none more amiable.But from the interview what flowed?
I lift a warning voice because
I like the difference to express
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
I love you with a brother's love,
I love you--to what end deceive?--
I loved you--what did I obtain?
I married--now, I supplicate--
I mean my name not to repeat."
I might to connoisseurs repeat
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared--
I must resign myself, in sooth;
I never should have seen your face
I on my chosen hero dote;
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I owe the censorship a little.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!--Did I so?--Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
I say without poetic phrase,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
I should alarm our friendship tried:
I slumber much, a little read,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I thank thee. In thy company,
I the same admonition make.
I then resolved my heart to tear;
I thought--retirement, liberty,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
I uttered to my lady fair
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I would desire my bride to be--
I would not part with finally;
I would your vigilance arouse,
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
I write, and anguish flies away,
I yield for splendid vanities,
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I yield with a low reverence;
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.--
I'm beaten in another matter;
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
I've had to make for having friends!But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
I've wasted in amusements vain,
I, after so much eloquence,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Idolatry of liberty,
If Olga smilingly approve,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
If cleverly or not I prate.But, O ye tomes without compare,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
If in the scenes of home I might
If not, the money I will lend."
If seriously he hath disease;
If the choice in my power were,
If the fond hope I could have fanned
If the poor maiden could have guessed
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If they were similar in aught.
If thou wert sitting by my side,
If wife and children to possess
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Imagination's sacred fires,
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Impelled to union with his own
Imperial portraits hang around
Impetuously clove its way
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impressed him in the least degree,--
Impressionable for an hour,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
In Russ her love made manifest,
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
In a half-open dressing-gown
In a lax or informal way,
In age the memory gets worse,
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In books he saw nought to condemn
In boston and the game of age,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.His malady, whose cause I ween
In charming fashion mutilate?
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
In company, or simply bowed,
In consultation stand aside--
In correspondence been allowed.
In country solitude you mope,
In country towns, where still it keeps
In course of time (the whole extent
In dreams and what the moon foretold
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In duel having killed his friend
In fact, some people were assured
In former years thus did not I
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!He was most gay. The happy date
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
In her friends' albums, time had been,
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In horror for itself alone,
In idleness and tranquil joy
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In life domestic see a string
In little maidens of thirteen?
In love adventures she was versed,
In love's campaigns Oneguine heard
In love, although its tempests vex,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In many things had changed his life--
In melancholy loveliness,
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
In motley and amusing chase.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In old age life is weariness!"
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.
In one he doth accounts behold,
In one of thine enchanting lays
In one thing really did excel.
In order due the maidens pull;
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In rhyming I show laziness.
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
In serious mood or dalliance
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solid, unpretentious style,
In solitude or worldly din,
In some a willing martyrdom.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
In spite of common sense we're wont
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
In springtime on the meadows green,
In such an album with delight
In that morass where you and I
In the French language perfectly,
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
In the beginning of this lay,
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
In the first place, say, am I right?
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the unfettered hours of leisure
In the unmoved, magnificent
In the world's mortal revelries,
In the world's vortex my success,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.In groups, official striplings glance
In their sterility of prattle,
In this case quite mistaken was.
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In thy imagination warm,
In time I'll give ye without fail
In times gone by thy bare command--"
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In vain was youth by us received,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In what he merely acquiesced.
In whispers low the neighbours said:
In winter by its blank and dim
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In winter, when Night longer holds
In worldly din or solitude
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
In your young days and also mine),
Incessantly his chains to break."I still a complication view,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Indifferent he became to all,
Indifferent was her future fate.
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Inflict annoyance and distress
Inhabited the country, clad
Inheritor of all his race.
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Insensible her hand remains
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable they remained.
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Inspired him with disgust and so
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Interrogation to denote.And my Tattiana now began
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Into delicious bondage gave
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the cups already sped
Into the district then to boot
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
Into the tangled garden goes
Into thy hands my fate I yield!No answer! He another sent.
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Introduce verse in conversation.
Invigorate imagination
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever ready with relief,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Is it for long?"--"Ma chere cousine!"
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Is it that human restlessness
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Is once again made manifest.
Is petted by the Emperor?--
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Is still condemned in love to be;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.No one the contrary will urge,
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
It carries of antiquity
It gradually possessed his mind;
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
It may be that I did proceed--
It may be that his martyred shade
It may be ye were born, or there
It may be, I yield nutriment!
It now to investigate is time,
It occupied him from a boy,
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
It will be by a mob beset
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Its driver seated on the rim
Its ebullition foaming white
Its insignificance I know
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.The butt of scandal having been,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Ivan Petrovitch still a gaby,
Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jilted--glad of a holiday.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just as he entered. How severe!
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at that time his father died,
Just at the hour we designate
Just at this moment I cannot.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Just manages a feeble trot
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Know that thy face that day I see.
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Known unto children perfectly:
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lay languishing both day and night--
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Learn to possess more self-control.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Lenski as a good match received,--
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Lessons to give he understood!How soon he learnt to titillate
Lest jaded with satiety,
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Let me explain that in my song
Let me present ye to the man,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Let us go seek a little rest--
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like D when dinner doth inspire.Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Like Leonora did she ride
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a full moon magnificent.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like down from Aeolus's lip,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown--
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Like you and me and all the rest?--
Likewise an epitaph with tears
List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
Listen to me without disdain.
Listless is she the livelong day
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Lo! my Oneguine free as air,
Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Lo! with what pride celestial
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Long ago?"--"'Tis the second year."
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Long in this fashionable cell
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Long since I held thee at the font--
Long time her young imagination
Long time in meditation deep
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Long, long the hour had past when home
Longer the East inert reclines
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Longtime was her heart desolate
Look through the window and kill flies.
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Lost in the hamlet far away.And in addition youth is flame
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Love to idealize inclined;
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Love's tender transports and distress,
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Made revelations undesigned,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Make up your mind to go there."--"Ah!
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Man--forty years long in this wise--
Many an ancient legend which
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May be that I by heaven's decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
May well in innocence impart.
May yet be studious of his nails;
Me now, inflict upon me pain?--
Me your perfections would not bless;
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Meantime Oneguine's apparition
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Meantime in matutinal dress
Measured with great exactitude.
Meet punishment for him provide.
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Men become friends from idleness.But even thus not now-a-days!
Men love no more, as only the
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Men will forget me, but my urn
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
Merciful God, what will he deem?"
Method was dear unto his heart
Metreless verses recognizing
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Minutely I will now portray.
Miraculously fair arise,
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Moina recalls for this alone
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Morality taught scarce at all;
More advantageously appear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
More troublesome than usual?"--"No!
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Moscow
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Moscow, Russia's darling daughter,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Most by this circumstance offended
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Most usually a Cossack horse
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must be pronounced unfortunate--
Must bow in common courtesy;
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
Must now my stanzas occupy.Tattiana was her appellation.
Must take a walk and rest a bit--
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My country and an exile's lot;
My country's honour and repute
My days of life approach their end,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
My famous portrait indicate
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My guardian angel to the grave.
My heart of old would captivate.
My heart with but one look revive;
My heart's allegiance can resign,
My heroine, Tattiana dear.Vladimir, hourly more a slave
My image hath not disappeared,
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mother-in-law who lately died
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My pretty self-deceiving maid--
My scholar without aptitude
My soul I cannot renovate--
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My spirit with such pangs before.Another time, so willed it Fate,
My splendid house and gaieties--
My sportive Muse I used to take
My sum of happiness contained;
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
My unpretending page shall fill,
My venerated reader, oh!
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My very latest composition!
My word of honour given have I.The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Mysteriously all objects near
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Napoleon tarried till it please
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Nay, near--but destiny decreed--
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.When, wise at length, we seek repose
Near Khariton's in a side street
Near young Tattiana resident,
Nearer they come--Eugene appears!
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never for me to reappear--
Never upon my heroine
Next Saturday. The Larina
Night separated from her spouse,
No coquetry was there, I vouch--
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
No longer through her former home;
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him; unto
No more the music thunders loud,
No more the village knows his face,
No more with pale Diana's rays,
No novelty--is it not true?--
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one my anguish comprehends,
No other book had time to read.
No other than Oneguine mine.
No sense was ever manifest
No senseless fashionable lay
No signs of trouble her accused,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
No trace ye left in passing by
No, ever to behold your face,
No, never in the early blaze
Noblesse and models of the mode,
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand
None, be my witness Heaven above!
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor aught confides unto the rest.Tattiana would have gladly heard
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor further comment that night made.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceed--
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Not high in general estimation;
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not so! My Moscow never went
Not that she had his works perused,
Not the least trace Oneguine sees
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Not to behave as he did once--
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Nought in the universe refused:
Nought of its charms original
November at the gate did stand.The morn arises foggy, cold,
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!"Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Now I am ready to refuse.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Now all things round about repeat
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
Now it is ready to be sent--
Now of a family the head,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
Now with what eager interest
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
O Men, how very like ye are
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
O epic Muse, my powers increase
O feet, where'er your path extends
O my Svetlana.'--Joukovski
O triumphs of my guileless days,
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared."
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
Obedient then to Nature's law,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?--
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
Obsequious or indifferent!
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Of "comme il faut." Shishkoff, forgive!
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Of London life is "vulgar" called
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of Russian domesticity;
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of a most mournful episode,
Of a strange night when the moon and--
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of affectation innocent,
Of all the guests within his mind.Certainly not Eugene alone
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Of consolation all bereft--
Of conversation, thought and aims--
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Of error and the passions' strife.
Of every sort and every set!"--
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of fiery youth's untutored days
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of foreign whims the impersonation--
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
Of friends the grateful intercourse--
Of friends unceremonious would
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of her provincial innocence
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of languor and of love did tell
Of late I have been quite absurd,--
Of life or death predestinate.
Of love again, and yet again;
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of many an economic scheme;
Of migratory gipsy hordes--
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of modern Russians the disease.Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of old maids the divinity,
Of one thing till again we met.
Of passion reminiscences,
Of passion they so often raise.
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the AEneid, but incorrect.
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine--
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of the horizon she is like!"--
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the romances she preferred,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of touching lightly every theme.
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of your perfections in my soul,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Oft staring through the window pane
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Olga began to long likewise
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olga the tea must supervise--
Olga with trepidation dire.
Olga's admirer came that day:
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
On Sundays by yon window he,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
On balls I madly used to dote,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
On everything around her gaze,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
On guests their servants used to wait
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On horseback every day they ride--
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
On innocent delights I dote,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On lines invisible are fixt;
On melted wax in water poured;
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
On the dull stage find all things changed,
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On thee I used to meditate!
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.Resolved the flirt to cast away,
On unknown female forms he throws.
On us beyond the grave attends,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
On whom a sister's heart was set
On winters of the south a skit,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
One image occupied his mind,
One instrument for his own use--
One moment's slumber suffer not.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
Oneguine Olga bore away.
Oneguine acted very well
Oneguine could not now submit,
Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
Oneguine his excuses says;
Oneguine knew enough, the rogue
Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Oneguine meditative stood,
Oneguine ne'er as poet showed
Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.
Oneguine sat the table by
Oneguine slowly then began
Oneguine then approached and said:
Oneguine to the window went
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."
Oneguine was a citizen
Oneguine was the most impressed,
Oneguine was--so many deemed,
Oneguine wasted; on my word,
Oneguine went with trepidation
Oneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Oneguine's letter!"--"Ah! the thing!
Oneguine's pencillings. His mind
Oneguine's speeches I abhorred
Oneguine, O my gentle readers,
Oneguine, bored to death again,
Oneguine, by first impulse moved,
Oneguine, hast forgotten yet
Oneguine--take him up again--
Oneguine--the beloved place
Only her countenance assumed
Open the window--sit by me."
Opened the portals of the tomb
Opened with care, and entering bore
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
Opens unto her visitor.
Oppressive now is happiness,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or "Idol mio," and in the grate
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or any trifle else ye like
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or better,--like a faithful wife.I was for calm existence made,
Or bosom full of languid fire,--
Or but for fame he saw the light;
Or by a card our homage pay,
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Or e'en the "Demon" of my strain.
Or else ,
Or even overcome by wrath
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or faults of grammar on its page--
Or for the solitary tomb
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or innocently past me fly.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or kiss the border of her dress.To Olga frequently he would
Or letters of a maiden young.And by degrees upon him grew
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or parody of modern ways?Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Or that adoring Grandison
Or the delivery of a note.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.She seemed of him oblivious,
Or torturer malevolent?
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
Or will my melancholy glance
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or, parable more flattering,
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Original imagination,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helene,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
Our liberty at least survives:
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our paradise is no more sweet.Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Our union would produce but grief.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Ourselves as unities to count;
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
Page after page continued reading,
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Pardon I ask for such a sin--
Paris and Menelaus right.
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Passed into dull eternity,
Passes the torrent But alack!
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pelagie Nikolavna has
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance one more affectionate.
Perchance they laurels also cull--
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!"--
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petoushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Philanthropist or patriot,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.China and bronze the tables weight,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Placed at the customary range;
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Poetic transport. They impart
Poetical enthusiast,
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Portray the solitary den
Portrayed contemporary man
Possess my love and sympathy.
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Possession hath no power to please,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Present me."--"You are joking."--"No."--
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Presents her quarto amiably,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Priams of country populations
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Providence otherwise may deem--
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?--
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
Quite a sensation; the position
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raises within my breast as oft
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Rebuffed--as quickly reassured,
Received him freely at her house,
Recent instructions of its mother.But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Regained authority awhile,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Relate some ancient history."
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Repentance wields not now her spell
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Repose in peace, thou child of song_."
Rescue me from oblivion.Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Resounding through all ages might
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Returning, from his ship amid
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Rings from a dish of water full
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Rooted unto the spot remained.As if against obstruction sore
Round which revolves the universe.
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Rural LifeCanto The FourthThe less we love a lady fair
Russia's Terpsichore review
Said something in an undertone
Sailed silently in unison--
Sails her allotted course on high,
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Scornfully challenged you afield--
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Secure in rural quietude--
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Seductive, animated, bright,
See, I can hardly crawl about--
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Selfish nonentities around?
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Serve who could neither read nor write.Time was, in style magniloquent
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Shall I behold thee once again?"--
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
She brought with her the gift of song.
She buries deep within her breast
She calm and unconcerned appears.The husband comes and interferes
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She cannot--Eugene oped the door
She cannot--then impatiently
She comprehends. The simple maid
She consolation thence obtained--
She could not sleep in her new bed.
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think "procrastination
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
She enters a deserted yard--
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--
She found herself alone at last,
She from the winter corn espies
She gazed around her--it was day.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She gazed--a cue, forgotten long,
She got a book of nursery tales,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She hears of conversation nought
She hears the bear behind her press,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She is an angel! We sometime
She led me through nocturnal mist
She leisurely away doth ride,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She murmurs in an undertone
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She never of deception dreamed
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She rose--departed. But Eugene
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She seeks the garden in her need--
She sits alone--'tis ever _she!_So frequently his mind would stray
She soon forgot, began to call
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She strains her throat to force a cry--
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She the delicious novel reads,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She visited the humble tents
She waited for--I don't know whom!
She waits, on fire her trembling frame--
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
She was as heedless and as gay--
She will not see, she will not hear.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce _a la Francaise_;
She, than the morning moon more pale,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Should be respected throughout life
Should dearly like a dance again.
Should go, the market for a maid,
Should make me much more circumspect,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Shouts of applause! Oneguine passes
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sickness more courage doth command
Sighs on another than her lord
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Simeon Petrovitch just as shabby;
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bear--
Since leisure was together spent,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sits down and gazes on all sides--
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
So Tania to her heart's content
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
So ardently did I desire
So be it! But internal strife
So be it! Just the laws which bid
So from the mountain lazily
So full of piety, correct,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
So inaccessible to men,
So irremissible appear?O ye whom tender love hath pained
So let us to the ball-room haste,
So many neighbours here exist--
So meantime let him joyous live
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit--
So prudent, and so circumspect
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So she in French herself expressed.
So there will be a dance to-night.
So uncongenial to my mind,
So, when he came next day to call,
Society endures not such!
Society he duped enow."
Society renounced once more.
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Some Russian authors he perused--
Some a mazurka occupies,
Some are afar and some are dead.
Some army poet therein may
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Some future ignoramus shall
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Some one or other editor
Some other long-departed Spring,
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Sometime collected, shall relate
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Spared him not their asperities.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Speech was so tame and colourless
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Spoiled children most degenerate
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still for ever fare thee well.'--Byron
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still of his club he member was--
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight for the entrance then he made
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?"--
Strange unto her each childish game,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Striking the intellect with awe
Struck Lenski dead--across the scene
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.I write to you! Is more required?
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Subscribed, _toujours a vous, Annette;_
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Such open-hearted innocence.
Such was Oneguine's sainted life,
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Swift following in her wake, the sun,"
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Take to their wings and fly away.But to Oneguine! _A propos!_
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Tania doth by the casement linger
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tania well nigh expired when he
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tattiana
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick--
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Tattiana certainly infers
Tattiana courage doth regain
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana every day conferred
Tattiana faltered, and became
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana gently led them there.And long her eyes as through a haze
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana learns the intelligence--
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana motionless abides.The strife grew furious and Eugene
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.The limits of enlightenment
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Tattiana to the index flies
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Tattiana with impatience waited
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Tattiana's letter I possess,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?"--
Tattiana--thus the sex is born.--
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
Tender and elevated, free?
Terpsichore alone among
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
Terror of guardians of the night;
Than cold Oneguine's oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Than one's own fascinating self.Here I remark all poets are
That Heaven her character had blent
That I am rich, a prince's wife?--
That I forget not whom I sing.
That I to you reveal my mind?
That Nina's marble symmetry,
That a friend's arm in every case
That afterwards with evil smile
That all may hear his voice's tone.Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
That certain volumes she might read.Adieu she to the matron said
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That every morn at Verrey's cost
That first the Muse appeared to me.
That for that matter in my verse
That girl whom once on a time he
That girl--but he must dreaming be--
That glimmered through the radiant night
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That guests approach: and when above
That he was "ready any day."
That heart with inspiration sweet
That hero, though his merit shone,
That is, he could elucidate
That like a friendly voice its tone
That mediocrity alone
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
That my dishonour would ensure
That our desires which noblest seemed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?And so my noon hath come! If so,
That the two friends with morning's light
That until Christmas comes again
That vanished are my youthful days,
That vicious set whom I don't blame--
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That we her constantly betrayed
That year the autumn season late
That youthful heart--"But, now at least,
That, for the century designed,
That, tipsy once in actual fight,

The PoetCanto The SecondThe village wherein yawned Eugene
The Princess N. will be at home
The Russian N with nasal sound
The Russian language I deem vile
The Russian winter did adore
The accents wild of other's woes,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of love--
The altar flame was quenched in night.Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
The amatory science warm,
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The artful prisoner should seek
The artifice of villany--
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.I tried when I began this tale,,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The bard his answer waits at home,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bays of age and helplessness.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The blessings of humanity.Or, it may be, the bard had passed
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The calm existence which I prize
The captain of a company.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The child of sloth and liberty.
The china teapot too ye might
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The clue unto some mystery
The coach before a house stood still.
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
The company deep silence guard.
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The connoisseur his glances throws
The contact of the foot I raised
The conversation tedious
The conversation was revived
The converse of our hermits twain,
The converse of the world polite,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The country hath its liberties
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The crash of music, candles' glare
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The crystals of her vestibule
The curs away to kennel chase,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The cynosure of every eye.
The damsel under escort place."Can I inspect the mansion, please?"
The days of love and of romance!
The days which to your youth belong?
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The deuce with my inside has played."
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
The disenchanted glass direct
The door flew open--Olga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The drama of my youth was played.
The dream left terror in its train.
The drive becomes monotonous--
The drum already doth arouse.
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The early tinkling of the bells
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The epitaph on marble shows:
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The eyes of a grave general.
The fair of the next generation,
The fair, nor parted with regret,
The family of Kharlikoff,
The family of children hie.
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal hour had come at last--
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The fated nutriment desired;
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fervid poet would recite,
The fever of the blood to slake--
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The fires of passion and its smart--
The firmament in mellow light,
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The forests in mysterious gloom
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The friend of liberty and laws
The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,
The frolics of maidens.They sang, whilst negligently seated,
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The general who accompanies.
The giddy world at last shall see.
The gifted songster never swerved,
The gilding of life's vanities,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The glass unwittingly inspect
The goblet still is bubbling bright--
The goddess would a masquerade
The golden ember now enshrines,
The gossip of their ladies fair.Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
The guests make room; aside each takes
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The happiest days of life employ?Love, flowers, the country, idleness
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero is of my narration!
The hero we immortalize.
The hero's name too in advance,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The hostess doth interrogate:
The hour when--Fate so willed--we met
The house and garden I would see."
The household property contain:
The household troop of little boys,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The imagination to enliven
The indignation of her heart!
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
The insensate fire of love still glowed
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lady in the crimson cap
The lady's glance upon him fell--
The lamps illuminating shine;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The language of her girlish pleading
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
The last poor obol I was worth--
The laws of generations past,
The letter is the thing, you see,--
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The lily's stem to eat away,
The little solitary nook
The lively trash of stories long
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The maid whose note he still possessed
The maiden at her casement sits
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
The maids beside Tattiana keep--
The malady of hopeless love
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The manners of the highest class
The master always used to sit."Departed Lenski here to dine
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The matter did not agitate,
The medium is required of gold.
The memory of the bard was driven
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The men salute with lower bows
The military band will play.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The moderns of the ancients rave--
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The monsters of the British Muse
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night--
The most industrious man alive
The motley moving mass and bright,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.
The native Russian tongue impeach?
The natural fickleness of passion,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
The nightingale there all night long,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The nights of golden Italy
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The old man who has had his freaks,
The olden time shall be my theme.Old people's simple conversations
The opportunity is flown.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The pall of night was growing thin,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
The path of hope and tender fear--
The path which leads to glory's goal.
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The perfidies I recollect
The pervert world with icy chill
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.Already crisp hoar frosts impose
The poet fell; already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The poet's fervid conversation
The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
The poet, modest though so grand,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The prejudices all men have,
The prince's eye Oneguine seeks:
The princess from the sofa cried
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
The reaping girls approach and ply
The remnant destiny concedes,
The rigour of cold pride and all
The riot of the world and glare
The river through the linden wood.
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
The room my former master used.
The ruts of his own fatherland.Yet on a frosty winter day
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
The secrets of maidens.
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
The shining orbs of night appear;
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open; to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitaph--a tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine;
The snow upon the streets doth melt--
The snows from off the hills around
The solstice of our earthly years,
The sorrows of a single state.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The starry beacons fade away,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The steward sent a note to tell
The stomach doth admonish us.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The story of his young love's dream,
The story of thy life and fate.
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The style in which my hero dressed;
The style of wise antiquity.
The sudden rattling of a car.
The sum of my existence gone
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogs--
The time for mystic strolls which late
The time when Melancholy's claw
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two friends' compliments she hears
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chides--
The uncontaminated kiss
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The venerable dame opined
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.He who hath lived and living, thinks,
The vestibule finds empty quite--
The vile seducer shall not dare
The voice of jealousy is drowned.In my young days of wild delight
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The windows whitened, shutters close--
The wit of others to acquire.
The witching light of sympathy;
The wolf upon the highways bold
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
The woods, still naked to the view,
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
The workpeople she superintended,
The works of Mr. Richardson.She was thus fond of Richardson
The world enough. Congratulate
The world is ever altering!
The young Simeonova too there
The young proprietor we find;
The youthful lover once again
The youthful poet's fond confession.
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Their Jealousy and separation
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.She loved upon the balcony
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their slander e'en was weariness;
Their voices nought to her impart
Then be it so! My destiny
Then became busy with the house,
Then dressed himself...
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.Congratulations, toasts resound,
Then he'd malign them secretly
Then in the silent cabinet
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then, her distraction to allay,
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, then--well, in some solitude
There Didelot became glorious,
There an imperious skeleton;
There came a sudden flash of light,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
There our Katenine did revive
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
There, in that knot of company,
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
Thereon the passing traveller read:
These are your relatives, believe:
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
These take their seats; the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smile--
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bit--they scandalise--
They hand in hand to table go.
They have invited you this week.""Me?"--"Yes! It is Tattiana's fete
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expected--
They made him feel inclined to doze;
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
They sat, but conversation's flow
They sent their compliments--but oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
They were the wonderful traditions
They will receive us with delight."
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
They would not solemnly debate
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Thine honour is my countersign!Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
This anchorite amid his waste
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This gentle daring who could guess?
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This great discovery relief
This he believed: a kindred spirit
This is my master's sitting-room.
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
This monument of thought profound
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This separated us as well--
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,
This, this were true felicity!
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Thou also, my ideal true,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though I'll return to him right early,
Though around honoured Priam's throne
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsought--
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Though late, have a beginning made.
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather;
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though without palaces and streets,
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Thrice happy who their agonies
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?He quits the fashionable throng
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus oft--this I myself confess--
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Thus to assassinate the eve?"--
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little tale--
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!""Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!"--
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantation--
Till January fell no snow--
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till morn--life uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seatShe sank.--
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was, the poet's tender quill
Time was, two maidens from their home
Time will the ravages efface--
Time without me will lessons give,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Tiresome unto her hath become
Titles and ages intermixed.
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To Eve the universal mother,
To God eternal hymns of praise.
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Russ indigenous are not;
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To a surrender gave consent,
To accompany him and to escort
To agitate me in my dreams.When, where, and in what desert land,
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
To all she answers cruelly--
To an assembly--she appeared
To anticipate the break of day,
To arid selfishness resigned,
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
To array himself in evening dress.
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To ask her name the trouble took.
To banish far unworthy themes
To be a charming mystery:
To be in conversation clear
To bear love's parching agonies--
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To burn, yet reason keep awake
To captivate her how devoted!
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fair--
To classicism I've homage paid,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To crush me with a just disdain.
To dire contentment shall give birth
To dominate her worthy lord,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To ease the anguish of my breast.
To end with him her path below.To Love all ages lowly bend,
To fawn upon and love express;
To find in gossip such delight,
To flight before her radiant look,
To follow you in every place,
To foreign lands he would allude,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
To friendship making no pretence,
To guess how you the eve pull through."--
To happiness contributing.
To help her to the other shore
To her an elegy composed.
To his Penates now returned,
To idle musing was a prey;
To jest as he had done last eve,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To labour in his sledge forgot,
To lawless love I should prefer--
To lay two covers secretly.
To light had brought them from their dust,
To listen to the rippling rill.
To listen to the words you speak,
To loiter there in idleness
To look on life as on a show,
To make wise men the idiot play
To male acquaintances he bows,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To me he would his Olga give,
To mention the foregoing eve,
To move in fashionable life,
To mutter her concealed desire
To my old nurse alone peruse,
To our Tattiana conquering,
To part in amity with thee!
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To pass with reasonable men
To peer into the future tries.
To purest love he tuned his note
To raise a clamour and a din:
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
To russify the foreign phrase
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To secrets of virgins,
To see aught--never mind meanwhile)
To see his Olga ere the fray--
To see you by our fireside stand,
To seek him out with bended head.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To sigh and meditate alone:
To sketch myself that I have tried
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To standards in which we believe?
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To such--delightful to repel.
To swagger as the art of love,
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To take this letter to O-- Well!
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To the fair object of his dream,
To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried now--
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
To understand by slow degrees
To vary for a few brief days.For two whole days it seemed a change
To visit Moscow in the season.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To wander through the meadows still,
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
To what malicious merriment,
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To whom are our misfortunes grief
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,--
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
To write his forefathers to warn
To write in cantos twenty-five.I've thought well o'er the general plan,
To write of any other elf
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
To-morrow before break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Together moments one or two
Together they returned, nor word
Together we have wandered o'er
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
Tome of "Malvina," and but three
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
Took aim--but as immediately
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Transfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
Transported to our Russian clime.
Trembles at artificial shame.The shining pistols are uncased,
Trembles upon my lips from spite,--
Trembling he seeks the young princess--
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Troy's sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Two dressed in uniform appear--
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Two verses he could recollect
Undeviating and insane
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Undressed herself and went to bed
Unfavourable unto her.
Unhappily too salt by far;
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Unknown to all, without a tie,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Until her heart less high should bound--
Until her powers of running fail.She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
Until the sleepless Breguet chime
Unto Anicia for the keys
Unto a carping world must show--
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto her husband, went away--
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell--
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Unto the gates the servants fly
Unto the hero of this lay
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Unto the windmill he must ride
Unto their solitude one day,
Up to the attic, and all need
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?--
Upon her brow sits wrath alone--And it may be a secret dread
Upon her cheek by adulation
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon his couch insensibly;
Upon its damp opacity,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon my visions such intrude.Fresh aspirations I have known,
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon those margins she perceived
Upon those pages she descries
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Us from the world wherein we live.Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Variety of speech and vests,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Villages in the distance show
Virgins miraculous I see,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.But now our minds are mystified
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Vladimir Lenski visited
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Vladimir something curtly said
Vladimir's property, a man
Vociferously paid her court,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Waiting his coming--his alone!
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was certainly no Grandison.
Was certainly not erudite
Was drawn, ideal of my lay--
Was famous for thick-headedness.Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Was he in health and void of care?--Even so! His passions soon abated,
Was it not so?--for thee I gave,
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook--
Was with himself dissatisfied.In fact, the subject analysed,
Was withered ere the morning light--
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Was younger than myself, my light,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
We all of us of education
We are the first who such a name
We called to mind our youthful days--
We glide along a floor of wax.
We hear with interest intense
We must admit but little taste
We visit about Christmas Day,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
Well known unto Oneguine mine.
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.In cruel solitude each day
Well! Larina appears to us
Well! just as she was yesterday."Why did you leave last night so soon?"
Were I like you a bard by trade--
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
Were you in love when you were young?"--"Alack! Tattiana," she replied,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
What I by relatives conceive?
What a storm of emotions keen
What acrimonious scorn I trace
What agitation languidly
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
What do I ask? What cause assigned
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What more's required? The world replies,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgot--
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What say you? to the family--
What they in conversation said?--
What visions then her fancy thronged--
What will the coming dawn reveal?
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
What, invitations? The same day
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When I yon semicircle bright
When Passion's fire no longer glows
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
When deaf and silent he doth lie
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
When first upon my cheek I feel
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When he in ardent verse portrays
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
When in as instant she is lost,--
When in her walks abroad she met
When in simplicity ye wrote
When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When in the study's calm retreat,
When motionless your gaze beneath
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When separation's hour drew nigh,
When shall I wing my passage free
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
When the hour came to bid good-bye--
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When the sonorous Breguet tells
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When will the devil take his own!"
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
When, sitting by his fire alone
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Whene'er he had an aching head;
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where I can no more recollect?--
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Where all upon the surface lies,--
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where better?
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,--
Where the first time she met with _him_.Thus widely meditation erred,
Where thine equal shall we find?
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where youth ?
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Where--"--"What! another eclogue spin?
Wherefore am I your quarry held?--
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Wherein a space Oneguine spent.
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Whereto in language courteous
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.How in the country pass this time?
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Which glowed with virginal desire.When but a boy he Olga loved
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Which might for many ages last.Surely ye all have overhauled
Which never have existed, e'en
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which we experienced long ago.Alas! he loved as in our times
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst struggling for the heritage.Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?Oneguine whither gallops? Ye
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who early died a gallant death_,"
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
Who labours hard to humour us?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?"--
Who without more prevarication
Who words and actions will adjust
Who would the maiden innocent
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes--
Whom thirty centuries adore.I will with thy divinity
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Whom you in slumber may have seen."But she, her sister never heeding,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
Why did you visit our poor place?
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will he pursue?--But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass; the same to-morrow try--
Will sound an insult in your ear.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Will you?"--"Agreed."--"I thank you, friend,"
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Winter's approach she doth not hail
With "vale" finish off a note;
With Eugene pranks of former years
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With Olga; nor of this appeared
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With affectation,--nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With all their progeny were there,
With an imagination wild,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome;
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blessings on the ditches and
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With cherries, red currants,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With clouded brow stands silently?
With dance and with song.
With deeper woe than others' grief.
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With eye precise and without fail.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With great delight.--O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With him were friends eternally:
With his exasperated sense,
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!Homeward returning, he at home
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With humble prose I'll fill my page
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With it may be a couple more;
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With little knowledge and that wrong
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With love which happiness extends;
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
With many a snare their pathway line!
With many a vacancy, 'tis said."--
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With measured step and even gait
With mute appeal to ask they seem--
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With our Oneguine doth aspire
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With raspberries, cherries.
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With scandal's trivial ornament.
With serious air then went away
With shame I shudder and with dread--
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness;
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.Having abjured the haunts of men,
With tears which secret sufferers love--
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--With unanimity complete,
With tenderness hath recognized
With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!
With the epistle of my fair;
With thee I conversed when I bore
With this immoderate request
With this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tranquil air Oneguine leads
With tumult or contentment still
With us 'tis quite a novelty
With us is easily attained.
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Within that secret court discussed,
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?Happy he who in youth was young,
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete;
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.How well he played the greenhorn's part
Would haste in agitation dire
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she in silence long remain.Contemplativeness, her delight,
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?"--
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and then--
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?Perchance to benefit mankind,
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Yes, happy--though she at his side
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Yonder the household lad doth run,
You choose."--"But who is she?"--"My wife.""So thou art wed! I did not know.
You fall in love again. But still--
You in the least commiserate
You know that I am now a fool--
You never since your nose have shown.
You never would have heard the name,
You o'er your wine insulted hath--
You will not all abandon me.
You with stern countenance declare
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
You'll spend your winter famously!
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Your conversation cold and hard,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!"--
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
_Affectionately yours till death_.
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
_Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
_Who in thy love finds more delight
